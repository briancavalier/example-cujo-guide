==================

A step-by-step guide to building a cujo.js based app

Details
-------

In this project we will build a simple [cujo.js](http://cujojs.com/) app that manages "variables", i.e. arrays of numbers with some context to them, as used in many statistical analysis contexts. At this point, this is meant to illustrate the steps involved in setting up a cujo.js app.

The steps will be identified as "days", and each will come with its own commit (excepting these first few initial commits of course). Accompanying the commit will be a text file describing the steps taken on that "day". Doing a diff of two consecutive commits can show you exactly what was added in that day.

Alright, let us begin!
